# Lab Report 5 - Putting it All Together (Week 9)

## Part 1 – Debugging Scenario



## Part 2 – Reflection

In the second half of this quarter, I think `bash` and `vim` is 2 very cool things that I have learn in CSE 15L. The bash scripts makes me understand more how autograder work and vim allows me to view files in terminal easier. `grep` and `find` are two very useful commands I learned. Also when doing my practice skill demo, I am able to understand in what situation `mkdir -p`, `touch`, `rm` and `mv` can be used. `mv` and `rm` is especially useful when I am only using my terminal and type or create the wrong file and would like to rename it or delete it. When doing my skill demo, I also realize despite I learned and able to do most of the commands, I am still a little unfamiliar on how to apply them, especially for the new tasks that appear in the real skill demo test. This encourage me to review my notes and make sure I understand all the concepts such that I can improve my coding skills.
