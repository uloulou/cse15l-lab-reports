# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and FileSystem (Week 1)
## Command `cd`
1. Using `cd` ***without*** an argument

The working directory was `/home` when the command was run. `cd` with no argument will brings the directory back to home. Thus, the output is not an error.

2. Using `cd` with a path to a ***directory***

The working directory was `/home` when the command was run. `cd` with a path to a directory will change the directory to `lecture1`. Thus, the output is not an error.

3. Using `cd` with a path to a ***file***

The working directory was `lecture1` when the command was run. `cd` with a path to a file will cause an error as `cd` is used for changing directory and a file is not a directory. Thus, there is an error in the output.

## Command `ls`
1. Using `ls` ***without*** an argument

The working directory was `/home` when the command was run. `ls` with no argument will show the file and folder names in the current working directory, which is **lecture1** in the `/home` directory in this case. The output is not an error.

2. Using `ls` with a path to a ***directory***

The working directory was `/home` when the command was run. `ls` with no argument will show the file and folder names in the current working directory, which is **lecture1** in the `/home` directory in this case. The output is not an error.

## Command `cat`

* A screenshot or Markdown code block showing the command and its output
* What the working directory was when the command was run
* A sentence or two explaining why you got that output (e.g. what was in the filesystem, what it meant to have no arguments).
* Indicate whether the output is an error or not, and if it's an error, explain why it's an error.
