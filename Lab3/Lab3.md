# Lab Report 3 - Bugs and Commands (WEEK 5)

## Part 1 - Bugs
1. A failure-inducing input for the buggy program, as a JUnit test and any associated code

```
   @Test
   public void testReversed1() {
     int[] input1 = {1,3,5,7 };
     assertArrayEquals(new int[]{ 7,5,3,1}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input1));
   }
```

2. An input that doesn't induce a failure, as a JUnit test and any associated code

```
   @Test
   public void testReversed2() {
     int[] input2 = {0,0};
     assertArrayEquals(new int[]{0,0}, ArrayExamples.reversed(input2));
   }
```

3. The symptom, as the output of running the tests (provide it as a screenshot of running JUnit with at least the two inputs above)

4. The bug, as the before-and-after code change required to fix it (as two code blocks in Markdown)

```
@Before

static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
  int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
  return arr;
}

```

```
@After

static int[] reversed(int[] arr) {
  int[] newArray = new int[arr.length];
  for(int i = 0; i < arr.length; i += 1) {
    newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];
  }
  return newArray;
}

```

**Why the fix addresses the issue?**

- In the Before code, even though a new integer array newArray is created, the line `arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];` in the for loop is updating everything element in the arr with elements in the newArray (which is empty as it is newly created) and return arr which causes all the elements in the arr to be 0. 

- In the After code, I replaced the line `arr[i] = newArray[arr.length - i - 1];` with `newArray[i] = arr[arr.length - i - 1];` and also make it `return newArray;` instead of `return arr;`. Thus, when the for loop runs, all the empty elements inside the newly made newArray will be updated with the elements inside arr in reverse order. Furthremore, as we return to newArray, it will result it a reverse order of the input arr when `reversed(int[] arr)` is called.

## Part 2 - Researching Commands

*I find all the commands through `man grep` on VSCode.*

**1. grep -i**

It finds the files contains the string despite the case as it makes it case insensitive. This is great for saving time in pressing caps locks to finding the exact contents.

**2. grep -L**

It shows names of files that does not containing selected lines, which is great for data cleaning.

```

**3. grep -C num**

It prints lines befor and after each match depending on what I put in num. It is helpful when I want a recap for the files with weird names that contains the word I want without clicking into each of them.

**4. grep -n**

It prints line number in the file containing the thing I want to search along with the output line. It could help with locating the documents and specific words quicker when it has a lot of lines.
